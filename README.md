This is a full-stack web application that makes use of Node.js, Express and MongoDB to showcase a candy business.

The purpose of this project was to create a website for a candy treat business where a business owner would be able to display their products for consumers. With user authentication, the business owner is able to edit and delete content on the site such as treats, services, faq's, etc. Consumers are able to view the contents of the website as well as send potential orders to the owner via email.
